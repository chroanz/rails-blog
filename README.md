# README

Welcome! This is my blog app.

To make everything work fine you'll need ruby installed in your machine and connection to the internet.

I'm using Ruby on Rails 8.0.1 and some dependencies which you may install during the step by step guide.

First of all, clone this repository or just download it.

Open the blog folder and run bundle install, it will download and install all of the dependencies for you.

Run rails server and the Puma serve will start.

Access http://localhost:3000 to get in the homepage of the app.

You'll se some posts, you can click on "See more..." to open the post and read the comments.

To create a new post you need to sign up, feel free to try it by yourself!
